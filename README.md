# plugin-overleaf

It works but without OAUTH it is not useful for Kooplex. There is no way to:
* use the same userbase
   * we could try this: https://github.com/worksasintended/overleaf_ldap
   * or SAML https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml/blob/master/README.md
* share folders or projects with Kooplex

* SITE URL does not really work
